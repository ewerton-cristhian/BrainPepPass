# BrainPepPass
BrainPepPass: A framework based on supervised dimensionality reduction for predicting blood-brain barrier-penetrating peptides.

### Overview

BrainPepPass is a machine learning (ML)-based framework that uses a supervised Supervised Laplacian Eigenmaps (sLE) and Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithms (XGB) to predict if natural and chemically modified can cross or not the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This computational tool uses structural and physiochemical properties extracred from peptides to predict the permeability.
